pokemap.net source

Update 19/09/2016
I've been asked what I'd improve within the source code if I personally were to continue development. In response to this I'd check if the user input is safe, maybe improve geolocation within location.js, encrypt user input (or provide HTTPS), and the search.css could use a clean-up.

I exported the SQL in CSV format. This should be easy to upload. The table should be called 'pokemarkers'.
